# What is it?

This Java project is a small demonstration to experience what it might be to navigate a virtual world blind or without vision.

This demo world consists of:

- A small rectangular room.
- The player moving and navigating throughout the room.
- Two items each with a distinct sound.  One sounds like a flare and the other sounds electronic with a recurring beep.
- **(New Feature)** The blue item will slowly move towards the user getting louder and louder as it gets closer.

# Getting Started

- Plug a pair of headphones into the computer and put them on.
- Try opening and running the Main.java file.
- Make sure that the samples are loaded in properly.
- Use the A, D, W, S keys to move throughout the room.
- Notice how the volume gets louder as you move closer to an item.
- Notice how if an item is to the left, you hear it better on the left ear.  Notice a similar effect for the right ear.
- Use spacebar to enable limited visuals and an aerial view map.
